    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Forecasting:**  \n",
    "   - Predict sales for the next 30 days for each product category.  \n",
    "   - Identify and leverage trends and seasonality in sales patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demand Planning:**  \n",
    "   - Determine products or categories likely to experience surges in demand.  \n",
    "   - Reduce overstocking and understocking through accurate forecasts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization:**  \n",
    "   - Optimize production schedules and inventory management.  \n",
    "   - Identify periods requiring special promotions to counter seasonal declines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Understanding**  \n",
    "   - **Data Collection:** Gather historical sales data, pricing, promotions, holidays, and external factors (e.g., weather).  \n",
    "   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform statistical analysis and create visualizations to uncover trends, seasonality, and anomalies.  \n",
    "   - **Data Quality Assessment:** Identify and address missing, inconsistent, or irrelevant data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Preparation**  \n",
    "   - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Normalize sales data if necessary.  \n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering:** Create lag variables, rolling averages, seasonal indices, and encode categorical variables for modeling.  \n",
    "   - **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Modeling**  \n",
    "   - **Baseline Models:** Develop simple models such as moving averages or exponential smoothing for benchmarking.  \n",
    "   - **Advanced Models:** Train machine learning (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Prophet).  \n",
    "   - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tune models to enhance accuracy and efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation**  \n",
    "   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Use RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.  \n",
    "   - **Visualization:** Plot predicted vs. actual sales to analyze trends and deviations.  \n",
    "   - **Model Selection:** Choose the best-performing model for deployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inventory Management:** Ensure optimal inventory levels, minimizing costs associated with overstocking or stockouts.  \n",
    "- **Production Planning:** Use forecasts to adjust production schedules based on predicted demand.  \n",
    "- **Promotional Campaigns:** Identify low-demand periods and design targeted promotions to boost sales.  \n",
    "- **Revenue Forecasting:** Provide accurate revenue projections to guide financial planning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the expected sales for the next 30 days for each product category?  \n",
    "2. Which products or categories show clear trends or seasonal demand patterns?  \n",
    "3. How can accurate demand forecasts improve inventory management and reduce operational costs?  \n",
    "4. Which time periods require targeted promotional strategies to mitigate sales dips?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Insights  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seasonal Trends:** Sales demonstrate clear peaks during holiday seasons and dips during specific months.  \n",
    "2. **Top-Selling Products:** Analysis of product categories reveals best-performing items and their contribution to revenue.  \n",
    "3. **Demand Surges:** Certain products experience predictable spikes in demand, enabling proactive inventory management.  \n",
    "4. **Model Performance:** LSTM and SARIMA models outperformed baseline methods in forecasting accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project equips retail businesses with powerful forecasting tools to make data-driven decisions. By understanding historical sales patterns, businesses can optimize inventory, enhance production efficiency, and maximize profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction.\n"

    "#### High Error Rates (MAPE):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both training and testing MAPE are near 100%, which is extremely high. This indicates that the model struggles to accurately capture the proportional changes in the time series.\n",
    "- The model fails to generalize well to unseen data, suggesting issues with either:\n",
    "    - Model complexity (insufficient learning capacity for this dataset).\n",
    "    - Data preprocessing or the inherent nature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting or Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference between training and testing metrics is small, indicating that the model may be underfitting the data rather than overfitting.\n",
    "- This might occur because the model complexity (50 units per layer) is not sufficient to learn intricate patterns in the sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MAE and RMSE Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The RMSE values **(1159.31 for training, 1280.00 for testing)** show that the error magnitude is substantial in both cases.\n",
    "- The slightly higher testing RMSE suggests a marginal degradation in performance on unseen data, a typical sign of limited model capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effect of Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite varying epochs and batch sizes, the high MAPE persists. This suggests that neither increasing training duration nor tuning batch sizes effectively improves the model's performance.\n"
