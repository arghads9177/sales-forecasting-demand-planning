    "## Business Objectives  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Forecasting:**  \n",
    "   - Predict sales for the next 30 days for each product category.  \n",
    "   - Identify and leverage trends and seasonality in sales patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demand Planning:**  \n",
    "   - Determine products or categories likely to experience surges in demand.  \n",
    "   - Reduce overstocking and understocking through accurate forecasts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization:**  \n",
    "   - Optimize production schedules and inventory management.  \n",
    "   - Identify periods requiring special promotions to counter seasonal declines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Understanding**  \n",
    "   - **Data Collection:** Gather historical sales data, pricing, promotions, holidays, and external factors (e.g., weather).  \n",
    "   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform statistical analysis and create visualizations to uncover trends, seasonality, and anomalies.  \n",
    "   - **Data Quality Assessment:** Identify and address missing, inconsistent, or irrelevant data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Preparation**  \n",
    "   - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Normalize sales data if necessary.  \n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering:** Create lag variables, rolling averages, seasonal indices, and encode categorical variables for modeling.  \n",
    "   - **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Modeling**  \n",
    "   - **Baseline Models:** Develop simple models such as moving averages or exponential smoothing for benchmarking.  \n",
    "   - **Advanced Models:** Train machine learning (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Prophet).  \n",
    "   - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tune models to enhance accuracy and efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation**  \n",
    "   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Use RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess model performance.  \n",
    "   - **Visualization:** Plot predicted vs. actual sales to analyze trends and deviations.  \n",
    "   - **Model Selection:** Choose the best-performing model for deployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inventory Management:** Ensure optimal inventory levels, minimizing costs associated with overstocking or stockouts.  \n",
    "- **Production Planning:** Use forecasts to adjust production schedules based on predicted demand.  \n",
    "- **Promotional Campaigns:** Identify low-demand periods and design targeted promotions to boost sales.  \n",
    "- **Revenue Forecasting:** Provide accurate revenue projections to guide financial planning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the expected sales for the next 30 days for each product category?  \n",
    "2. Which products or categories show clear trends or seasonal demand patterns?  \n",
    "3. How can accurate demand forecasts improve inventory management and reduce operational costs?  \n",
    "4. Which time periods require targeted promotional strategies to mitigate sales dips?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Insights  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seasonal Trends:** Sales demonstrate clear peaks during holiday seasons and dips during specific months.  \n",
    "2. **Top-Selling Products:** Analysis of product categories reveals best-performing items and their contribution to revenue.  \n",
    "3. **Demand Surges:** Certain products experience predictable spikes in demand, enabling proactive inventory management.  \n",
    "4. **Model Performance:** LSTM and SARIMA models outperformed baseline methods in forecasting accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
