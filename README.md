## Business Objectives  

1. **Sales Forecasting:**  
   - Predict sales for the next 30 days for each product category.  
   - Identify and leverage trends and seasonality in sales patterns.  

2. **Demand Planning:**  
   - Determine products or categories likely to experience surges in demand.  
   - Reduce overstocking and understocking through accurate forecasts.  

3. **Optimization:**  
   - Optimize production schedules and inventory management.  
   - Identify periods requiring special promotions to counter seasonal declines.

## Methodology  

### 1. **Data Understanding**  
   - **Data Collection:** Gather historical sales data, pricing, promotions, holidays, and external factors (e.g., weather).  
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform statistical analysis and create visualizations to uncover trends, seasonality, and anomalies.  
   - **Data Quality Assessment:** Identify and address missing, inconsistent, or irrelevant data.  

### 2. **Data Preparation**  
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Normalize sales data if necessary.  
   - **Feature Engineering:** Create lag variables, rolling averages, seasonal indices, and encode categorical variables for modeling.

### 3. **Modeling**  
   - **Baseline Models:** Develop simple models such as moving averages or exponential smoothing for benchmarking.  
   - **Advanced Models:** Train machine learning (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Prophet).  
   - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tune models to enhance accuracy and efficiency.  

### 4. **Evaluation**  
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Use RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess model performance.
